## Imperia

Imperia is a versatile Discord bot designed to be a comprehensive solution for a wide range of tasks. Planned scope of the bot is still being defined, but will include features such as: server administration, moderation, utility, and entertainment.

> **Note:** Imperia is on a indefinite *semi-hiatus*. I'm not actively working on it, but I'm not abandoning it either. I'll work on it when I feel like it, currently it's mostly a skeleton with some basic features.
